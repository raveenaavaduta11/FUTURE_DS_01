## 📊 Data Science & Analytics Internship Project | Power BI Dashboard
I’m excited to share my Business Sales Dashboard, developed as part of my Data Science & Analytics internship at Future Interns.
Using the Superstore e-commerce dataset, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze business performance and support data-driven decision-making.

🔍 Key insights covered:
• Sales trends over time
• Top 10 best-selling products
• Revenue contribution by category
• Key KPIs: Total Sales, Orders, Quantity Sold & Average Sales

🛠 Tools & Skills:
Power BI | Excel | DAX | Data Cleaning | Business Insights | Data Visualization
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of transforming raw data into meaningful business insights through effective dashboards.
📌 GitHub repository link is shared in the comments.
I’m open to feedback and continuously learning!
